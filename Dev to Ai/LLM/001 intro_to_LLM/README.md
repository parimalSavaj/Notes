## intro to LLM

> 1. what is LLM?

- LLM ks full form of Large Language Model.
- here what means of large? large in terms of parameters, large in terms of data, large in terms of complexity. ( currently remember this parameters and other things later on we will discuss about this )
- and what means of language? language is a way of communication between two or more people.
- and what means of model? model is a mathematical representation of a system.

> 2. LLM in simple words

- LLM ak model he jis ko pahle large dataset of text se train kiya jata he or then vo human language ko understand karta he and **predict karta he generate karta he**.

> 3. short history of LLM

- 1950s: ELIZA

rule based chatbot, only question and answer.

- 1999s: n-gram

rule ke badle probabilities. example: "I love \_" -> "I love you" that type of prediction. here large text dataset ki help se predict kiya jata he. but not handle long context. this first move to statistical NLP ( natural language processing ).

- 2013: Word2Vec

here representation of words in vector space. Foundation for modern deep NLP.

- 2017: Transformer ( Attention is all you need )

here Key idea: Self-Attention mechanism. Considered the “birth” of the modern LLM era. Backbone of GPT, BERT, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.

- 2018: BERT & GPT-1

- 2020: GPT-3

- 2022+: LLM boom

- 2023: LLaMA

- 2024: GPT-4

- 2025: GPT-5

- 2026: GPT-6
